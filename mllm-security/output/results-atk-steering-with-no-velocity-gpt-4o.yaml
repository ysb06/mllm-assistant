      car encounters a yellow light, prompting it to proceed with caution while passing
      through. At the second intersection, the car faces a red light, which likely
      requires it to slow down or stop before proceeding. Throughout these maneuvers,
      the car maintains a steady course down the city street, braking often but never
      coming to a complete stop, ensuring a smooth and controlled passage through
      the intersections.
  question: What about the manoeuvers when passing through the intersections?

    message: The turning maneuver involved a range of steering angles, indicating
      that the ego-car made several adjustments to navigate the turn. The presence
      of both positive and negative angles suggests that the turn was quite dynamic,
      with significant steering input required. This indicates a relatively sharp
      or complex turn, likely due to the need to navigate around the traffic jam ahead.

    message: Based on the current situation, the traffic is quite slow, and the ego-car
      is mostly stationary behind a stopped trailer. This indicates that there is
      significant congestion in the area. While one car managed to maneuver around
      a trailer in the lane to the left, suggesting some movement is possible, the
      overall traffic flow seems to be heavily impeded. If the congestion persists,
      it might take some time for the traffic to clear up. However, without additional

      turn. Initially, the car stopped and waited for a vehicle to pass, ensuring
      it was safe to proceed. This was a cautious maneuver due to the crossing vehicle,
      which required attention to avoid any potential collision. Once the path was

      turn left. Initially, the car was stopped at a red light, waiting for the crossing
      traffic to clear. Once the light turned green and it was safe to proceed, the

      was necessary to navigate the intersection and align with the new direction

      there is no indication of a lane change. The steering angles suggest some adjustments,
      but these could be for maintaining the lane or slight corrections rather than
      a full lane change. Therefore, it seems the car is driving in a constant lane.

      for it to turn green. While waiting, attention was given to a merging vehicle,
      ensuring safe conditions. Once the light turned green, the ego-car executed
      a left turn, which was a goal-oriented maneuver. During this turn, attention
      was again on a merging vehicle, maintaining awareness of the surroundings. Later,
      a vehicle cut in, prompting the ego-car to adjust its position to ensure safety.

    message: Yes, there was a traffic sign that required attention around the time
      when the ego-car was making a left turn and approaching a crosswalk. It's important
      to be cautious of traffic signs as they provide essential information for safe
      driving.
  question: Were there any traffic signs which we needed to be cautious of?

    message: As we approached the construction area, I noticed a truck that appeared
      to be pulling over, which likely indicated some roadwork or obstruction ahead.
      To navigate safely, I made a left turn, which was a goal-oriented maneuver to
      avoid the construction zone and continue on our intended path. During this time,
      I was attentive to any pedestrians near the ego lane and ensured that we passed
      through crosswalks safely. The maneuver was executed smoothly, allowing us to
      bypass the construction area without any issues.
  question: Can you tell me more about how we navigated the construction area?
