  expected_answer: One could say the pace of the drive was quite reflective of the
    obstruction complexities faced. In the beginning, we were moderately speedy, but
    as soon as we encountered the pedestrian crossing and the UPS truck, our pace
    slowed down quite a bit. We moved at a gentle speed while passing the truck and
    dealing with the intersection, but as soon as the path was clear, our pace picked
    up considerably.

    message: During this time, the traffic flow involves navigating a pedestrian crossing
      and a bicyclist in the oncoming lane. The ego-car initially drives straight,
      then maneuvers to the left to avoid a parked UPS vehicle on the right side of
      the road. The presence of a pedestrian crossing requires attention at two intervals,
      indicating that pedestrian activity is a significant factor in the traffic flow.
      The ego-car's velocity decreases as it approaches the pedestrian crossing and
      the intersection, suggesting cautious driving to ensure safety. After passing
      the intersection and the parked vehicle, the ego-car resumes a straight path,
      gradually increasing its speed. Overall, the traffic flow is characterized by
      careful navigation around pedestrians and parked vehicles, with adjustments
      in speed to accommodate these elements safely.

    message: The movement of the ego-car was not entirely smooth and gradual throughout.
      Initially, the car increased its speed, but then it had to slow down and eventually
      stop at a stop sign. There was a hesitation due to cross traffic, which caused
      the car to stop and remain stationary for a period. This indicates that the
      car's movement involved changes in speed and stops, rather than a continuous,
      smooth motion.

  expected_answer: At first, the car was moving in a road curving left. While the
    traffic signal was red, the ego-car began to change lanes to the right. Once the
    lane change was completed, our car began making a significant right-hand turn.

    message: As we approached the traffic signal, we were initially driving on a road
      that curved to the left. We then encountered a red light, which required us
      to slow down and prepare for a right turn. During this time, we executed a right
      lane change to position ourselves correctly for the turn. Once the light changed
      and it was safe to proceed, we completed the right turn at the intersection.
      Throughout this maneuver, we adjusted our speed accordingly to ensure a smooth
      and safe turn.

      without stopping, which is a common response when the light changes to yellow
      and the vehicle is too close to stop safely. Later, when the car approached
      the red light at another T-intersection, it likely slowed down or stopped, as

  expected_answer: Initially the car took some small turns presumably while passing
    through the intersection. After that, the car drove straight towards the red light

      down as it approaches a red light. Initially, the car is moving at a moderate
      speed, but as it gets closer to the intersection, it begins to decelerate. This
      deceleration is due to the presence of a red light and a car in front, which
      requires the ego-car to slow down and eventually come to a complete stop. The

      initially moved into the left lane as part of a goal-oriented maneuver. However,
      shortly after, it encountered congestion, which required a stimulus-driven response

      turning left at the next intersection, and then continuing straight, appears
      to be goal-oriented. This suggests that the maneuvers were planned as part of
      a route rather than being reactions to specific events or changes in the road

  expected_answer: Our car is programmed to not only acknowledge but also react to
    such situations. The crossing vehicle came into view from the 3rd to the 13th

    slow down to a point that the crossing vehicle could pass by.

    message: If the crossing vehicle was present when the ego-car was at full speed,
      it would have been crucial to react promptly to avoid a potential collision.
      The ego-car would need to slow down or stop to yield to the crossing vehicle,
      ensuring safety for both vehicles. The presence of a crossing vehicle requires
      heightened attention and possibly a quick adjustment in speed or direction to
      maintain a safe driving environment. The ego-car's systems are designed to detect
      such situations and respond appropriately to prevent accidents.

      lane changes. Initially, the car moved from the middle lane to the left lane,
      and then it made another left lane change, likely moving into the far-left lane.
      These maneuvers were part of a goal-oriented action to navigate through traffic,

  model_response:

      Our ego-car then executed a left turn, which was a goal-oriented maneuver, possibly
