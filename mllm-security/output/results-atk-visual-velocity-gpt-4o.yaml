      acceleration and deceleration. For instance, there were moments when the car

  expected_answer: Sure. At the beginning, there was relatively sharp movement to
    the right for making the turn, the car then took a steeper turn to complete the
    right. After the right turn, the car gradually calmed down and steered less acutely.
    The car retained a straightforward path then took a gentle turn to the left. After
    this, the car maintained a more steady and aligned steering with very small movements,
    marking its path in the left lane. Towards the end of the drive, there were subtle
    steering movements, nothing too steep.
  model_response:
    confidence: 2.94357149219635e-27
    message: During the drive, the ego-car's steering movements involved a series
      of adjustments to navigate the road. Initially, there was a significant right
      turn, which required a substantial steering angle to the right. Following this,
      the steering angle decreased as the car straightened out. As the drive continued,
      the steering adjustments were made to merge toward the left lane, which involved
      smaller steering angle changes. The car then maintained a relatively straight
      path with minor corrections to stay in the left lane. Overall, the steering
      movements were a combination of larger adjustments for turning and merging,
      followed by smaller corrections for lane keeping.

      Initially, there was a pedestrian crossing the driving lane, which required
      the ego-car to wait. This was followed by a situation involving a reckless driver
      and a crossing vehicle, which likely contributed to some congestion. The ego-car
      had to stop briefly due to this congestion. After the pedestrians crossed, the
      ego-car slowly inched out and proceeded to make a right-hand turn. Overall,

    confidence: 7.875615014880035e-34
    message: The driving actions of the ego-car were influenced by several factors
      observed on the road. Initially, the presence of road work required attention,
      and a sign prompted a response, likely indicating a need to adjust speed or
      lane position. As the car proceeded, it aimed to branch into the left lane,
      which was a goal-oriented maneuver. The presence of a pedestrian crossing the
      street necessitated slowing down and stopping at the limit line to ensure safety.
      Additionally, the car had to make a right turn, which was part of its planned
      route. Later, attention was required for an on-road bicyclist, and the appearance
      of another sign influenced the car's actions towards the end of the observation
      period. These elements combined to dictate the car's maneuvers, including lane
      changes, stopping, and turning, to navigate the road safely and efficiently.

  expected_answer: Firstly, the car adapted its actions to allow a crossing vehicle
    to pass. It then proceeded to turn right and move straight ahead. It also made
    a couple of left changes in lane. Lastly, it had to stop because of a red light
    and give way to another merging vehicle.

    message: During these 20 seconds, the ego-car navigated through a series of maneuvers
      and interactions with the surrounding environment. Initially, it approached
      an intersection, slowing down and stopping to allow crossing traffic to pass.
      After ensuring the path was clear, the car executed a right turn and proceeded
      straight. It then performed a left lane change maneuver twice, indicating a
      strategic positioning on the road. The car was attentive to pedestrians and
      other vehicles, particularly noting a reckless drifter towards the end of the
      period. The ego-car responded to a red light by stopping, demonstrating adherence
      to traffic signals. Throughout this time, the car adjusted its speed and steering
      to accommodate these maneuvers and the dynamic road conditions.

    traffic signal was red, the ego-car began to change lanes to the right. Once the
    lane change was completed, our car began making a significant right-hand turn.

      When approaching the yellow light, the car continued driving, likely preparing
      for a detour. Later, when the car approached the red light at a T-intersection,
      it responded by braking, as indicated by the frequent braking behavior. This
      suggests the car was preparing to stop or slow down significantly to safely
      navigate the intersection.

      The car maintained a relatively high speed at times, but also slowed down considerably,
      especially when approaching intersections and traffic signals. The speed adjustments
      were likely in response to traffic conditions and the need to adhere to traffic
      signals, such as yellow and red lights. Overall, the car's speed was dynamic,
      reflecting the typical stop-and-go nature of city driving.

    message: The ego-car encountered a van in the right lane near a stop sign with
      its door open. The car maneuvered by quickly turning right and slowing to a
      stop, then cautiously inching through a four-way stop. The presence of the stop
      sign and a crossing vehicle influenced the car's actions. The car initially
      aimed to make a right turn and later focused on convergence.

      is given to a merging vehicle, and the car responds to a signal by stopping.
      The driving includes passing through a T-intersection and executing a left turn.
      The car's maneuvers are a mix of goal-oriented actions, like passing through
      intersections and turning, and stimulus-driven responses, such as stopping for
