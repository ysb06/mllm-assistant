  expected_answer: Sure. At the beginning, there was relatively sharp movement to
    the right for making the turn, the car then took a steeper turn to complete the
    right. After the right turn, the car gradually calmed down and steered less acutely.
    The car retained a straightforward path then took a gentle turn to the left. After
    this, the car maintained a more steady and aligned steering with very small movements,
    marking its path in the left lane. Towards the end of the drive, there were subtle
    steering movements, nothing too steep.

    message: During the drive, the ego-car initially makes a significant right turn,
      as indicated by the larger steering angles. After completing the right turn,
      the steering adjustments become less pronounced as the car maneuvers to merge
      toward the left lane. The steering angles then stabilize as the car continues
      to follow the left lane heading straight. Throughout the drive, the steering
      movements reflect the car's navigation through a T-intersection and eventually
      passing a crosswalk. The adjustments in steering are responsive to the road
      events and the car's intended maneuvers.

    message: The driving actions of the ego-car were influenced by several factors
      observed on the road. Initially, the car encountered road work, which required
      attention and likely influenced the decision to maintain a straight path. The
      presence of a pedestrian crossing ahead necessitated slowing down and changing
      lanes into a left turn lane, where the car stopped at the limit line to allow
      the pedestrian to cross safely. This action was stimulus-driven by the crossing
      pedestrian. Additionally, the car's maneuvers were guided by goal-oriented actions,
      such as branching into the left lane and executing a left turn. Towards the
      end of the observation period, the presence of a merging vehicle and a sign
      also influenced the car's actions, ensuring safe navigation through the traffic
      environment.

    and proceeded straight. We had to pay attention to a pedestrian close to our lane
    at the beginning, a sign, and a crossing pedestrian in our journey. However, all
    these situations were handled well.

    message: The maneuvers of the ego-car involved completing a left turn and then
      proceeding straight. During the left turn, the steering angles indicate significant
      adjustments, which is typical for such a maneuver. After the turn, the steering
      angles stabilize as the car goes straight. The presence of a sign and crossing
      pedestrians required attention, and the car also encountered a traffic jam.
      These factors suggest that while the maneuvers were generally smooth, the driver
      had to be attentive to various road events, which is normal in driving situations.
  question: Were our car's maneuvers all smooth and normal?

    message: The ego-car turned right in the driving scenario as part of its maneuver
      to navigate through a stop sign-controlled intersection. After coming to a stop
      at the stop sign, the car completed a right turn. This action was likely a planned
      maneuver to continue on its intended route, as indicated by the goal-oriented
      behavior of making a left turn shortly after. The right turn was a necessary
      step in the process of navigating the intersection safely and efficiently.

  expected_answer: Our car is programmed to not only acknowledge but also react to
    such situations. The crossing vehicle came into view from the 3rd to the 13th

    stationary.

    message: Yes, when I mentioned the car was stopped, it meant the ego-car was not
      moving at all. This was a reaction to the traffic light, as indicated by the
      "stop_4_light" behavior.
  question: When you say the car was stopped, did it mean the car was not moving at
    all?

  expected_answer: Unfortunately, the presence of oncoming traffic along with the
    red signal at the intersection prohibited our ego-car from turning left at the
    time.
  model_response:
    confidence: 2.4866174238080327e-07
    message: The ego-car didn't turn left because there was oncoming traffic that
      prevented it from making the turn. Even though the car was in the left turn
      lane, the absence of a traffic light at the intersection meant that the car
      had to yield to oncoming vehicles before it could safely complete the turn.
  question: So why didn't the car turn left if it was in the left turning lane?

    message: As we approached the construction area, I noticed a truck that appeared
      to be pulling over. This required careful navigation. Initially, I focused on
      making a left turn, which was a goal-oriented maneuver to adjust our path. During
      this maneuver, I was attentive to any pedestrians near our lane to ensure safety.
      After completing the left turn, I continued to monitor the surroundings, especially
      as we passed through crosswalks, which required additional attention to ensure
      the safety of any pedestrians. The construction area likely required us to be
      cautious and adapt our path to avoid any obstacles or workers present.
