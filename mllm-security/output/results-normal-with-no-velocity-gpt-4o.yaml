  expected_answer: Sure. At the beginning, there was relatively sharp movement to
    the right for making the turn, the car then took a steeper turn to complete the
    right. After the right turn, the car gradually calmed down and steered less acutely.
    The car retained a straightforward path then took a gentle turn to the left. After
    this, the car maintained a more steady and aligned steering with very small movements,
    marking its path in the left lane. Towards the end of the drive, there were subtle
    steering movements, nothing too steep.
  model_response:
    confidence: 9.036822185773553e-25
    message: Certainly! During the drive, the ego-car initially makes a right turn,
      which involves a significant steering adjustment to the right. After completing
      the turn, the steering gradually adjusts back towards a neutral position as
      the car merges left into a new lane. As the drive continues, the steering remains
      relatively stable with minor adjustments to maintain a straight path in the
      left lane. There are some slight corrections to ensure the car stays aligned
      with the lane, especially when passing through intersections and crosswalks.
      Overall, the steering movements reflect the maneuvers of turning, merging, and
      maintaining a steady course on the road.

    message: The driving actions of the ego-car were influenced by several factors
      observed on the road. Initially, the presence of a road work sign required attention,
      prompting the car to adjust its path. As the car proceeded, it aimed to branch
      into the left lane, which was a goal-oriented maneuver. The car then encountered
      a stop sign, necessitating a stimulus-driven stop. A pedestrian crossing the
      street required the car to slow down and stop at the limit line, ensuring safety
      before completing the left turn. Additionally, attention was needed for an on-road
      bicyclist and a merging vehicle, which influenced the car's actions to ensure
      safe navigation. Finally, another sign at the end of the observation period
      also played a role in guiding the car's actions.

    message: Yes, the maneuvers of the ego-car were smooth and normal. The car completed
      a left turn and then proceeded to go straight. During the left turn, the steering
      angles adjusted appropriately to navigate the turn, and once the turn was completed,
      the steering stabilized as the car continued straight. The car also responded
      to the presence of pedestrians and a sign, indicating attentive and safe driving
      behavior.

    message: During these 20 seconds, the ego-car navigated through a series of maneuvers
      and interactions with traffic. Initially, it approached an intersection, slowing
      down and stopping to allow crossing traffic to pass. After ensuring the path
      was clear, the car executed a right turn and continued straight. It then performed
      a left lane change, indicating a strategic adjustment in its path. As it approached
      another intersection, the car began to slow down in response to a red light,
      demonstrating its adherence to traffic signals. Throughout this period, the
      car was attentive to crossing and merging vehicles, ensuring safe navigation
      through the traffic environment. The performance of the ego-car reflects a careful
      and responsive driving style, adapting to both planned maneuvers and external
      stimuli.

      due to traffic conditions and maneuvers. Initially, the car stopped due to congestion
      at the four-way stop, indicating a decrease in speed. As the car approached
      the stop sign, it stopped again, reflecting another reduction in speed. When
      it was the car's turn to proceed, it executed a left turn at the intersection,

    message: During the drive, the ego-car encountered a few notable incidents. Initially,
      the car stopped at a red light, waiting until it turned green. During this time,
      attention was given to a merging vehicle, ensuring safe navigation. Once the
      light turned green, the car executed a left turn, which was a goal-oriented
      maneuver. While making the turn, the car adjusted its steering to navigate the
      corner effectively. Later, attention was again required when a vehicle cut in,
      prompting careful monitoring to maintain safety. Throughout these events, the
      ego-car responded by adjusting its steering and maintaining appropriate speeds
      to ensure a smooth and safe journey.
  question: How did we respond to these incidents on the road?

  expected_answer: Initially, our car made a right turn, likely as part of the planned
    route. After the initial turn, we continued moving forward straight. As we encountered
    parked cars along the way, the car had to adjust its path. On noticing a stop
    sign from 11th to 13th second, the car halted at the intersection. Subsequently,
    our vehicle again resumed its journey by turning left.

    message: The driving experience today involved navigating through a street with
      parked cars along the side. Initially, the ego-car made a right turn, which
      was part of a planned maneuver. After proceeding straight, the car approached
      an intersection where it stopped in response to a sign, demonstrating a stimulus-driven
      behavior. Following this stop, the car continued and eventually made a left
      turn at another intersection, completing the journey. The drive required careful
      attention to road signs and parked vehicles, ensuring safe and smooth navigation
      through the streets.

    message: As we approached the construction area, I noticed a truck that appeared
      to be pulling over, which required careful navigation. Initially, there was
      a pedestrian near our lane, so I paid close attention to ensure safety. We then
      executed a left turn, which was a goal-oriented maneuver to navigate around
      the construction zone. After completing the turn, we continued to drive cautiously,
      passing a sign and eventually crossing a crosswalk. Throughout this process,
      I adjusted the steering to maintain a safe path around the construction and
      any potential obstacles.
  question: Can you tell me more about how we navigated the construction area?
