  expected_answer: One could say the pace of the drive was quite reflective of the
    obstruction complexities faced. In the beginning, we were moderately speedy, but
    as soon as we encountered the pedestrian crossing and the UPS truck, our pace
    slowed down quite a bit. We moved at a gentle speed while passing the truck and
    dealing with the intersection, but as soon as the path was clear, our pace picked
    up considerably.

    message: During this time, the ego-car navigates through a relatively calm traffic
      environment. Initially, the car slows down, likely due to a crossing point for
      animals, and then continues to decelerate as it approaches a pedestrian crossing.
      The presence of a bicyclist in the oncoming lane is noted, but it does not seem
      to directly impact the ego-car's path. The car maneuvers to the left to avoid
      a parked UPS vehicle on the right side of the road while passing through a T-intersection.
      After this maneuver, the car gradually accelerates, indicating a clear path
      ahead. Overall, the traffic flow is smooth, with the ego-car adjusting its speed
      and position to safely navigate the road conditions and obstacles.

    message: The ego-car had to stop after entering the intersection because, although
      there appeared to be a gap in the traffic, not all opposing vehicles slowed
      down to allow for a safe left turn. One vehicle in the opposing lane did slow

      with the turn. This required the ego-car to wait in the intersection for a safer

      a red light and a pedestrian near the ego lane. The red light required the car
      to be cautious, and the pedestrian, described as a "self-absorbed individual
      in a zone of self-importance," likely necessitated additional attention and
      careful driving to ensure safety. These factors contributed to the car's reduced

      After completing the turn, it continued to drive straight. During this time,
      the car's speed increased steadily. At one point, the car had to pay attention
      to a diverging train, which might have required some caution. As the car approached
      a traffic light, it encountered a yellow light, prompting a cautious approach.
      When the light turned green, the car continued moving forward. Towards the end
      of the observation period, the car noticed a crossing vehicle, which required
      attention. Finally, the car came to a stop at a red light, which was a stimulus-driven

      The car had to slow down behind traffic ahead, which was moving through a crosswalk.
      This likely caused a delay in reaching the desired speed and maintaining a steady
      pace. Once past the traffic, the car was able to increase its speed, indicating

    message: As we approached the curve in the road, the ego-car smoothly adjusted
      its path to follow the leftward curve. This involved a gradual reduction in
      speed, allowing for a controlled and safe navigation through the curve. The
      steering was adjusted to maintain the lane and ensure a smooth transition through
      the curved section of the road. Once the curve was negotiated, the car continued
      towards the traffic signal where it prepared for a right turn.

    message: The ego-car's speed varied throughout the period, generally maintaining
      a moderate pace while navigating the city street. The car experienced frequent
      braking, which caused fluctuations in speed. Initially, the speed decreased,
      likely due to the presence of a yellow light and a crosswalk, before gradually
      increasing again. As the car approached a red light and a T-intersection, the

  expected_answer: Initially the car took some small turns presumably while passing
    through the intersection. After that, the car drove straight towards the red light

      down as it approaches a red light. Initially, the car is moving at a moderate
      speed, but it begins to decelerate due to the presence of a red light and a

      This is a common and necessary action to ensure the safety of pedestrians, especially
      in busy areas like a shopping center. The car's sensors likely detected the
      pedestrians crossing from the left, prompting it to slow down and come to a
      complete stop until they had safely crossed. This behavior is crucial for maintaining
      safety and adhering to traffic rules regarding pedestrian right-of-way.

      Once the light turned green and it was safe to proceed, the car began its left
      turn. The sharpness of the turn could be attributed to the need to navigate
      the intersection efficiently while ensuring the path was clear of any crossing
      vehicles or pedestrians.

      was part of its goal-oriented maneuver. However, upon noticing the pedestrian

    there were only minor adjustments to the vehicle's trajectory. However, as we
    noticed the other cars approaching, we slowed down and adjusted our direction
    to the right significantly to avoid collision. Once we passed the intersection,
    we adjusted our direction slightly to the left to get back on track.

      it would have been crucial to react promptly to avoid a potential collision.
      The ego-car would need to slow down or stop to yield to the crossing vehicle,
      ensuring safety. The presence of a crossing vehicle requires heightened attention
      and possibly a quick response, such as braking or steering adjustments, to maintain
      a safe distance and prevent any accidents. The ego-car's systems are designed
      to detect such situations and respond accordingly to ensure the safety of all
      road users.

    message: The ego-car was in the process of turning into a left turn lane. However,
      oncoming traffic was preventing the vehicle from completing the left turn, as
      there was no traffic light at the intersection to regulate the flow. The car
      maneuvered into the left turn lane and then came to a stop, likely due to a
      red light. During the drive, there was a brief pause for photography, which
      occurred shortly after the car began slowing down. The vehicle's speed decreased
      gradually until it came to a complete stop, where it remained for the rest of
      the observed period.
