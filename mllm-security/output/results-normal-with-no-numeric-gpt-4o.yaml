    intersection. It looked as if there was a gap in the traffic and one car from

      Initially, the presence of a road work sign required attention and likely prompted
      caution. The car then moved towards a left lane branch, indicating a goal-oriented
      maneuver to prepare for a left turn. As the car approached the intersection,
      a pedestrian crossing the street necessitated a stop, which was a stimulus-driven
      response to ensure safety. After the pedestrian crossed, the car completed the
      left turn, continuing its goal-oriented path. Additionally, the presence of

  expected_answer: At first, the car was moving in a road curving left. While the
    traffic signal was red, the ego-car began to change lanes to the right. Once the
    lane change was completed, our car began making a significant right-hand turn.

  expected_answer: Yes, our car extensively adjusted its speed during this journey.
    Initially, it decelerated, which is likely due to the curve in the road and then
    almost came to a stop, which might have been caused by a traffic signal. After
    the right turn, the car progressively increased its speed again.

    message: Yes, the speed of the ego-car likely changed during this segment of the
      drive. As the car approached a red light and prepared for a right turn, it would
      typically slow down to ensure a safe maneuver. Additionally, the process of
      changing lanes and making a right turn often involves adjusting speed to navigate
      the road safely and comply with traffic signals.

    and subsequently made a right turn at the subsequent pathway. The journey continued
    straight after that for another block.

    message: Certainly! During the journey, the ego-car navigates through a series
      of maneuvers. Initially, it makes a right turn, followed by a left turn at a
      light. As it continues, the car passes a crosswalk and then approaches an intersection
      where it makes another right turn. After completing the turn, the car proceeds
      straight for one block. Throughout the drive, there is a noticeable glare from
      the lights due to the dusk setting, which might affect visibility. Additionally,
      the car responds to a sign by stopping briefly, ensuring safe navigation through
      the area.
